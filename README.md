## My process

- At first, I linked the `style.css` file and the Google Fonts CDN with the `index.html` file.
- Then, imported the colour variables into the _css_ file from `style-guide.md` file and set the instructed base _font-size_ for this project. Also, I initialized the css file.
- After initialization, I wrote necessary `html` code to structure the _desktop-version of the UI Design Sample_ and also wrote necessary _css_ code to match the design as close as possible.
- After completing the _desktop-version UI development_, I wrote necessary _CSS Media Queries_ to develop the _mobile-version UI design_.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

By doing this project, I learned about css `linear-gradient()` and `box-shadow`.

**Linear Gradient**

```css
background-image: linear-gradient(
  to bottom,
  var(--light-slate-blue) 0%,
  var(--light-royal-blue) 100%
);
```

**CSS box-shadow**

```css
box-shadow: 0 10px 50px -12px hsla(241, 100%, 89%, 0.6);
```
